CNN for Image Classification - Cat vs Dog
1. Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.
Training Set: 4000 images of cats and 4000 images of dogs.
Test Set: 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs.
Single Image Prediction: Predicts whether a single image in the single_prediction folder is a cat or dog.
